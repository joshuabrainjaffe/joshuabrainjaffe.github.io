A repo for my first General Assembly project, a blackjack game

What are the features of your MVP?


  A dealer and a human player, playing to 21 (Aces count as 11 until a bust is imminent, which then reverts them to 1 ). Betting each hand, with a running total through out the game.

What aspects of your approach and attitude so far have been the hardest?


  I started off thinking very visually and graphically, so after planning with the team, I was already thinking of making it pretty before making is functional. Once I got started on actually coding, however, things have been pretty smooth. My other big flaw in coding and problem solver is that I tend to think very linear, so when I encounter a problem, I have a hard time moving on before that problem is solved.

What have you gotten done so far?


  Currently there's no betting system, but I get a shuffled deck of 52 cards and the player and dealer are both dealt 2 cards each. Then the player is able to hit and get new cards dealt to them. My current problem is the ace issue, ie; when the player is going to bust, it SHOULD decrease the value of the player's hand by 10 once for each ace in their hand, but it's not quite doing that.

What steps are you going to take to make sure that your goals are accomplished by project presentation time?


  I started a trello group with other classmates and we're sharing ideas and solutions as we solve problems. I place to get my working MVP, then I'll make it pretty, then I'll try to add more features, like multiple players, doubling down and card splitting.
